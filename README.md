# Airtable Scripts

This repository contains an assortment of scripts to use in Airtable. They're all completely free,
and while I do my best to ensure that they operate as intended, I make no guarantees that they're
error-free, nor about their effectiveness for your use case. In other words, these are all
"use at your own risk" scripts, especially those that modify base data.

Documentation for each script can be found in the script's folder.

*2023-02-25: It's going to take me some time to collect all of the scripts that I've written and shared
and add them to this repository. Please check back periodically to see what's new, or [subscribe
to my newsletter](https://airtable.com/shr4mckEBKVZtsw2T) to be notified when the repository
has been updated.*

## Scripting extension scripts

These scripts are designed to be used in the Scripting extension. In most cases they use features
that are exclusive to the Scripting extension, so they will NOT work as automation scripts. If any
of these scripts has a matching automation script variant, you'll find it in the "Automation scripts"
section below.

* **Get Table IDs** - Generate boilerplate code that allows you to easily refer to tables, fields,
and views by their IDs instead of their names.

*Coming soon...*
