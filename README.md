# Airtable Scripts

This repository contains an assortment of scripts to use in Airtable. They're all completely free,
and while I do my best to ensure that they operate as intended, I make no guarantees that they're
error-free under all circumstances, nor about their effectiveness for your use case. In other words,
these are all "use at your own risk" scripts, especially those that modify base data.

Documentation for each script can be found in the script's folder.

*2023-06-24: Added a couple of new scripts. Still nothing yet for automation scripts, but at least
one is on the horizon. Please check back periodically to see what's new.*

## Scripting extension scripts

These scripts are designed to be used in the Scripting extension. In most cases they use features
that are exclusive to the Scripting extension, so they will NOT work as automation scripts. If any
of these scripts has a matching automation script variant, you'll find it in the "Automation scripts"
section below.

* **Get Table IDs** - Generate boilerplate code that allows you to easily refer to tables, fields,
and views by their IDs instead of their names.
* **Recursive Hierarchy Labels** - Generate labels for records linked in a hierarchical structure.
* **Reverse Attachment Order** - Reverse the attachment order of files in a specified field.

## Automation scripts

*Please check back later...*
