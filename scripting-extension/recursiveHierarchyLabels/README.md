# Recursive Hierarchy Labels

When tracking items that are part of a hierarchy, it's often desirable to have an ID
(1.2.1.1) or path (Paul->Peter->Mary) that outlines the hierarchy tree. This script
parses records in a single table to build hierarchy labels, with the hierarchy established
by record links. Labels may be built in either direction: parent-to-child or child-to-parent.

## History

This script came about while helping a user in the Airtable community forum. It's been through
a few revisions while working out kinks and adding new features. See the script for a full
revision history.
